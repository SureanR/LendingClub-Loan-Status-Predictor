# LendingClub-Loan-Status-Predictor
The model was built to determine whether a borrower will repay their loan. The model was built using historical data on loans given out with information whether or not the borrower defaulted. The model was built using a subset of the LendingClub DataSet obtained from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club.
